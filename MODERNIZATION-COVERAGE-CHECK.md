# Modernization Coverage Check
## Comparing ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md vs MODERNIZATION-ROADMAP.md

**Purpose:** Verify that all modernization items are covered in architectural decisions

---

## Coverage Matrix

| Modernization Item | Priority | In ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md? | Category | Notes |
|-------------------|----------|-------------------------------|----------|-------|
| **Fix Build Quality Gates** | P0 | ✅ Yes | #8 TypeScript Strictness | Covered as "enable strict enforcement" |
| **Add Prettier** | P0 | ✅ Yes | #11 Code Formatting | Explicitly mentioned with golden rule |
| **Add Pre-commit Hooks (Husky)** | P0 | ✅ Yes | #11 Code Formatting | Husky + lint-staged mentioned |
| **Add Unit Tests (Vitest)** | P1 | ✅ Yes | #7 Testing Strategy | Vitest recommended with coverage targets |
| **GitHub Actions PR Checks** | P1 | ⚠️ Partial | #12 Deployment | Mentioned but not as core decision |
| **PostgreSQL Migration** | P1 | ✅ Yes | #1 Database Layer | Explicitly in decision (SQLite → PostgreSQL) |
| **Dependabot** | P1 | ⚠️ Partial | #12 Deployment | Mentioned but not emphasized |
| **Commitlint** | P1 | ❌ No | #11 Code Formatting | NOT mentioned in arch decisions |
| **Code Coverage Reporting** | P1 | ✅ Yes | #7 Testing Strategy | 80% threshold mentioned |
| **Monitoring (Sentry)** | P2 | ✅ Yes | #10 Error Handling | Sentry explicitly mentioned |
| **Security Scanning** | P2 | ❌ No | Missing | Trivy/OWASP ZAP not in arch decisions |
| **Secret Manager** | P2 | ✅ Yes | #12 Deployment | Explicitly mentioned as TODO |
| **OpenAPI Docs** | P3 | ❌ No | #2 API Layer | NOT mentioned |
| **Rate Limiting** | P3 | ❌ No | #2 API Layer | NOT mentioned |
| **CDN** | P3 | ❌ No | #12 Deployment | NOT mentioned |

## Summary

### ✅ Well Covered (9/15)
- Build quality gates
- Prettier
- Husky/pre-commit hooks
- Vitest unit testing
- PostgreSQL migration
- Code coverage reporting
- Sentry monitoring
- Secret Manager
- TypeScript strictness

### ⚠️ Partially Covered (2/15)
- GitHub Actions (mentioned but not as dedicated decision)
- Dependabot (mentioned but not emphasized)

### ❌ Missing from Architecture Decisions (4/15)
- Commitlint / Conventional Commits
- Security scanning (Trivy, OWASP ZAP, Snyk)
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Rate limiting
- CDN setup

---

## Why the Gap?

**ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md focuses on:**
- Code patterns and conventions
- Framework choices
- Development workflow decisions
- "How should we write code?"

**MODERNIZATION-ROADMAP.md focuses on:**
- DevOps tooling
- Infrastructure setup
- Automation and CI/CD
- "What tools do we need to run in production?"

**There's overlap but different emphasis.**

---

## Recommendation

### Option 1: Keep Separate (Recommended)
- **ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md** = Code/pattern decisions (how to build features)
- **MODERNIZATION-ROADMAP.md** = Infrastructure/DevOps decisions (how to deploy safely)
- **Add cross-references** between documents

### Option 2: Expand Architecture Decisions
Add 4 more categories to ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md:
13. **CI/CD Automation** (GitHub Actions, PR checks)
14. **Dependency Management** (Dependabot, security scanning)
15. **Commit Standards** (Commitlint, conventional commits)
16. **API Documentation** (OpenAPI/Swagger)

### Option 3: Create Summary Document
Create **PRODUCTION-READINESS-CHECKLIST.md** that combines both:
- Architectural decisions (12 categories)
- Infrastructure requirements (6 categories)
- Total: 18 decision points

---

## What Should We Do?

**Recommendation:** Option 1 (Keep Separate) + Add Cross-References

**Why:**
- Architecture decisions are about "how to code" (for developers/LLMs)
- Modernization roadmap is about "how to deploy" (for DevOps/infrastructure)
- Different audiences, different purposes
- Cross-reference so people know where to look

**Action Items:**
1. Add to ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md:
   - Section at top: "See also: MODERNIZATION-ROADMAP.md for infrastructure decisions"
2. Add to MODERNIZATION-ROADMAP.md:
   - Section at top: "See also: ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md for code pattern decisions"
3. Optional: Create **DECISION-INDEX.md** that lists all 18 decision categories in one place

---

## The 18 Total Decision Categories

### From ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md (Code Patterns)
1. Database Layer
2. API Layer
3. UI Components
4. Data Fetching
5. Auth & Permissions
6. Form Handling
7. Testing Strategy
8. TypeScript Strictness
9. File Structure
10. Error Handling
11. Code Formatting
12. Deployment & Environments

### From MODERNIZATION-ROADMAP.md (Infrastructure)
13. CI/CD Automation (GitHub Actions)
14. Dependency Management (Dependabot)
15. Commit Standards (Commitlint)
16. Security Scanning (Trivy, OWASP ZAP)
17. Monitoring & Alerting (Sentry, Uptime)
18. API Documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

## Next Steps

**Quick Fix (5 minutes):**
Add cross-references to both documents

**Medium Fix (30 minutes):**
Create DECISION-INDEX.md with all 18 categories

**Complete Fix (2 hours):**
Expand ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md to include infrastructure categories 13-18
