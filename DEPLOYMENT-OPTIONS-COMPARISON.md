```

**Why:**
- Fast feedback loop for feature development
- Automated testing catches issues early
- No manual intervention needed for development
- Low risk (not public-facing)

#### Production Environment: Cloud Build Trigger (Manual Approval)
```yaml
Environment: lobbyist-registration
Trigger: Manual approval on push to 'main' branch
Approval: Required
Purpose: Controlled, auditable releases
```

**Why:**
- Government systems require approval gates
- Audit trail for compliance
- Prevents accidental deployments
- Allows review before production release
- Supports database migrations
- Enables blue-green deployments
