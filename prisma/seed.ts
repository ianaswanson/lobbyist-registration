2. GOOD FAITH EFFORT: I made multiple attempts to submit the report on both July 14 and July 15 (the due date). After repeated failures, I contacted the County IT helpdesk on July 15 at 3:47 PM (ticket #2025-0715-047).

3. PROMPT COMPLETION: Once the technical issue was resolved, I submitted the report immediately on July 16, just one day after the deadline.

3. ADMINISTRATIVE ERROR: It appears there may have been an administrative error in processing my registration packet. The violation notice states the authorization was "not provided," but my records show it was included in the original submission.

The expense report in question accurately reflected my understanding of the lobbying activities at the time of submission. Any discrepancies were the result of unintentional errors, not deliberate misrepresentation.

Specifically:
- The meeting dates were transcribed from my calendar, which I later discovered had incorrect entries due to a calendar sync error
- The expense amounts were estimates based on typical costs for similar events
- I had no intent to deceive or provide false information

      decidedAt: new Date('2025-08-25'),
      decision: `After careful review of the evidence and the appellant's arguments, the appeal is DENIED and the violation is UPHELD.

FINDINGS:

1. SUBSTANTIAL INACCURACIES: The expense report contained multiple significant discrepancies beyond simple transcription errors. Three separate meetings were reported on dates when no meetings occurred, and expense amounts differed from receipts by more than 40%.

2. PATTERN OF ERRORS: This is not an isolated incident. The appellant's previous two quarterly reports also contained similar discrepancies, though of lesser magnitude.

3. RECKLESS DISREGARD: Even if the errors were unintentional, they demonstrate a reckless disregard for accuracy requirements. Lobbyists have a heightened duty to ensure accuracy in public filings.

4. REASONABLE VERIFICATION: The appellant had ample opportunity to verify information before submission, including cross-checking calendar entries and reviewing actual receipts rather than relying on estimates.

CONCLUSION:

While the Board accepts that the appellant may not have intentionally provided false information, the level of inaccuracy rises to the level of a violation under ¬ß3.807. The $500 fine is appropriate given the severity of the inaccuracies and the pattern of reporting issues.

The violation stands as issued. The fine must be paid within 30 days.`,

FINDINGS:

1. TIMELY SUBMISSION VERIFIED: System logs confirm that the appellant's Q4 2024 expense report was successfully submitted on January 12, 2025 at 4:23 PM, three days before the deadline.

2. COUNTY SYSTEM ERROR: The IT Department has confirmed that a database migration performed on January 16-17, 2025 inadvertently failed to migrate approximately 35 submitted reports to the new system.

3. APPELLANT NOT AT FAULT: The appellant took all required actions to comply with the deadline. The late availability of the report was entirely due to County system issues beyond the appellant's control.

4. GOOD FAITH COMPLIANCE: The appellant immediately resubmitted when notified of the issue, demonstrating good faith compliance.

CONCLUSION:

It would be unjust to penalize the appellant for a system error that was not their responsibility. The violation is overturned and the fine is dismissed.

The County apologizes for the inconvenience caused by the system migration issue.`,

After thorough review, the Chair finds that the best interests of the County favor this contract for the following reasons:

1. SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE: Mr. Chen possesses unique technical knowledge of the County's legacy database systems that would be difficult and costly to replicate.

2. PROJECT CONTINUITY: Mr. Chen led the initial planning phase of this modernization project before leaving County service. His continued involvement ensures project continuity and reduces risk of costly delays.

3. COMPETITIVE PRICING: TechCorp's proposal was 15% below the next lowest bidder and 30% below the average of all bids received.

4. NO UNDUE INFLUENCE: While Mr. Chen was Deputy IT Director, he had no authority to approve contracts. The contract authorization was made by the Board after his departure.

5. PUBLIC INTEREST: The database modernization project is critical for improving County services to residents. Delays would negatively impact service delivery.

Based on these findings, the Chair concludes that granting this exception serves the County's best interests and does not violate the spirit of ¬ß9.230.`,

        justification: `Written findings per ¬ß9.230(C):

The Chair finds that Mr. Martinez's influence on this contract was minimal for the following reasons:

1. LIMITED ROLE: As Senior Planner, Mr. Martinez was not involved in contract authorization or vendor selection decisions. These decisions were made at the Director level and above.

2. DIFFERENT PROJECT SCOPE: While Mr. Martinez worked on preliminary TOD studies, the current contract scope was expanded significantly after his departure to include additional neighborhoods not contemplated during his tenure.

3. ARMS-LENGTH PROCESS: The RFP was issued 8 months after Mr. Martinez left County employment. He had no involvement in drafting the RFP or evaluating proposals.

4. POLICY COMPLIANT: Mr. Martinez did not participate in any discussions or decisions related to this contract while employed by the County.

Based on these findings, the Chair concludes that Mr. Martinez's influence on contract authorization was minimal and granting this exception is appropriate.`,

        justification: `Written findings per ¬ß9.230(C):

The Chair finds that the best interests of the County favor this contract for the following reasons:

1. CRITICAL NEED: Maternal mortality rates in Multnomah County have increased by 18% over the past two years. This program addresses a critical public health emergency.

2. ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS: Dr. Foster developed strong partnerships with community health organizations that are essential to the program's success. Her continued involvement leverages these existing relationships.

3. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE: Dr. Foster's proposal included commitments from 12 community partners who specifically requested her involvement. No other bidder could demonstrate this level of community support.

4. LIMITED FINANCIAL BENEFIT: The contract value ($45,000) is below the threshold that would typically raise concerns about financial self-dealing.

5. TIME SENSITIVITY: The grant funding for this program expires in 90 days. Delays in contractor selection would result in loss of federal funds.

The Chair concludes that granting this exception serves the County's best interests and advances critical public health objectives.`,
