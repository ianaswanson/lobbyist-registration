        justification: `Written findings per ¬ß9.230(C):

After thorough review, the Chair finds that the best interests of the County favor this contract for the following reasons:

1. SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE: Mr. Chen possesses unique technical knowledge of the County's legacy database systems that would be difficult and costly to replicate.

2. PROJECT CONTINUITY: Mr. Chen led the initial planning phase of this modernization project before leaving County service. His continued involvement ensures project continuity and reduces risk of costly delays.

3. COMPETITIVE PRICING: TechCorp's proposal was 15% below the next lowest bidder and 30% below the average of all bids received.

4. NO UNDUE INFLUENCE: While Mr. Chen was Deputy IT Director, he had no authority to approve contracts. The contract authorization was made by the Board after his departure.

5. PUBLIC INTEREST: The database modernization project is critical for improving County services to residents. Delays would negatively impact service delivery.

Based on these findings, the Chair concludes that granting this exception serves the County's best interests and does not violate the spirit of ¬ß9.230.`,

        justification: `Written findings per ¬ß9.230(C):

The Chair finds that Mr. Martinez's influence on this contract was minimal for the following reasons:

1. LIMITED ROLE: As Senior Planner, Mr. Martinez was not involved in contract authorization or vendor selection decisions. These decisions were made at the Director level and above.

2. DIFFERENT PROJECT SCOPE: While Mr. Martinez worked on preliminary TOD studies, the current contract scope was expanded significantly after his departure to include additional neighborhoods not contemplated during his tenure.

3. ARMS-LENGTH PROCESS: The RFP was issued 8 months after Mr. Martinez left County employment. He had no involvement in drafting the RFP or evaluating proposals.

4. POLICY COMPLIANT: Mr. Martinez did not participate in any discussions or decisions related to this contract while employed by the County.

Based on these findings, the Chair concludes that Mr. Martinez's influence on contract authorization was minimal and granting this exception is appropriate.`,

        justification: `Written findings per ¬ß9.230(C):

The Chair finds that the best interests of the County favor this contract for the following reasons:

1. CRITICAL NEED: Maternal mortality rates in Multnomah County have increased by 18% over the past two years. This program addresses a critical public health emergency.

2. ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS: Dr. Foster developed strong partnerships with community health organizations that are essential to the program's success. Her continued involvement leverages these existing relationships.

3. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE: Dr. Foster's proposal included commitments from 12 community partners who specifically requested her involvement. No other bidder could demonstrate this level of community support.

4. LIMITED FINANCIAL BENEFIT: The contract value ($45,000) is below the threshold that would typically raise concerns about financial self-dealing.

5. TIME SENSITIVITY: The grant funding for this program expires in 90 days. Delays in contractor selection would result in loss of federal funds.

The Chair concludes that granting this exception serves the County's best interests and advances critical public health objectives.`,
