# Session Summary: UI Fixes - October 21, 2025

## Overview
Quick session to fix remaining UI issues discovered during testing.

## Changes Made

### 1. Email Notifications Card - Complete Removal
**File**: `app/(authenticated)/dashboard/page.tsx:297-326`

**Issue**: Email Notifications card was still showing on admin dashboard despite feature flag being disabled.

**Fix**: Wrapped the entire Email Notifications Quick Actions card in feature flag check:
```typescript
{FEATURE_FLAGS.EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS && (
  <a href="/admin/notifications" className="...">
    <!-- Email Notifications card -->
  </a>
)}
```

**Result**: Email Notifications completely hidden from UI when feature flag is false.

### 2. Expense Report Detail - Database Field Mismatch
**File**: `app/(authenticated)/reports/lobbyist/[id]/page.tsx:193-198`

**Issue**: Report detail page showing "N/A" for Description and Vendor columns.

**Root Cause**: Code was using incorrect field names that don't exist in database:
- Looking for: `item.description` and `item.vendor`
- Database has: `purpose` and `payee`

**Fix**: Updated to use correct database column names:
```typescript
// Before:
<td>{item.description}</td>
<td>{item.vendor || 'N/A'}</td>

// After:
<td>{item.purpose}</td>
<td>{item.payee || 'N/A'}</td>
```

**Result**: Expense report details now display correctly.

### 3. My Violations Page - Padding Cleanup
**File**: `app/(authenticated)/my-violations/MyViolationsClient.tsx`

**Issue**: Excessive white space and padding making page feel spacious and wasting vertical space.

**Changes**:
- Container: `py-8` → `py-4` (32px → 16px)
- Header margin: `mb-8` → `mb-4` (32px → 16px)
- Alert margins: `mb-6` → `mb-4` (24px → 16px)
- Table cells: `p-4` → `px-3 py-2` (16px all sides → 12px horizontal, 8px vertical)
- Card headers: Added `pb-3` to reduce bottom padding
- Card content: Added `pt-0` to remove gap between header and content
- Appeals section: `space-y-4` → `space-y-3` and `gap-4` → `gap-3`

**Result**: Much more compact page layout with better vertical space efficiency.
