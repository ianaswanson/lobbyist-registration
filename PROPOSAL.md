# Lobbyist Registration System - Project Proposal

**Prepared for:** Multnomah County
**Project:** Government Accountability Ordinance Web Application
**Date:** October 15, 2025
**Launch Deadline:** June 2026 (Before July 1, 2026 ordinance effective date)

---

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines the development of a web-based lobbyist registration and reporting system to satisfy the requirements of Multnomum County's Government Accountability Ordinance (ยง3.800-3.811). The system will enable lobbyists, employers, and board members to register and report lobbying activities, while providing public transparency through a searchable database and giving county administrators compliance monitoring tools.

We present three implementation approaches with detailed cost estimates for initial development and ongoing maintenance.
