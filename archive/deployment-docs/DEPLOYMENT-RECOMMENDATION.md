# Deployment Recommendation: Cloud Build Triggers

## Executive Summary

**Question:** Should we use Cloud Run's "Connect Repo" feature for automatic GitHub deployments?

**Recommendation:** ❌ No - Use Cloud Build Triggers instead

**Reasoning:** Cloud Run's direct "Connect Repo" integration lacks critical capabilities required for government systems: no pre-deployment validation, no approval gates, no audit trail, and no database migration support.

**Alternative:** ✅ Cloud Build Triggers with manual approval for production

---

## TL;DR

```
❌ Don't Use: Cloud Run "Connect Repo"
   - Too simple for government production systems
   - No approval gates, no testing, no audit trail

✅ Use Instead: Cloud Build Triggers
   - Auto-deploy to dev environment (for rapid iteration)
   - Manual approval for production (for safety)
   - Full audit trail (for compliance)
   - Cost: $0-10/month
```

---

## The Problem with "Connect Repo"

Cloud Run's "Connect Repo" feature is designed for simple applications, but it's **not suitable for government systems** because:

### Missing Critical Capabilities
1. **No pre-deployment validation** - Can't run tests, type checking, or security scans
2. **No approval gates** - Every push to main instantly deploys to production (dangerous!)
3. **No database migration support** - Can't run Prisma migrations before code deployment
4. **Limited audit trail** - Hard to prove who deployed what and when (compliance issue)
5. **No rollback mechanism** - Difficult to revert to previous working version
6. **No environment-specific builds** - Same configuration for dev and production

### Why This Matters for Civic Tech
Your lobbyist registration system has special requirements:
- **Compliance:** Need comprehensive audit trails for government accountability
- **Reliability:** Cannot risk breaking the public transparency dashboard
- **Security:** Must scan dependencies before deploying to production
- **Data integrity:** Database migrations must complete before code updates
- **Accountability:** Must prove who approved production changes

**"Connect Repo" fails all of these requirements.**

## Recommended Solution: Cloud Build Triggers

### Architecture Overview
```
GitHub Push → Cloud Build Trigger → Validation Pipeline → Deployment
                                    │
                                    ├─ Type checking
                                    ├─ Security scanning
                                    ├─ Run tests
                                    ├─ Build container
                                    └─ [Manual approval for production]

                                    → Deploy to Cloud Run
                                    → Verify health
                                    → Route traffic
```

### Two-Environment Strategy

#### Development Environment (Auto-Deploy)
```yaml
Service: lobbyist-registration-dev
Trigger: Automatic on push to 'develop' branch
Approval: None (continuous deployment)
Purpose: Rapid iteration and feature testing
Pipeline: Type check → Security scan → Build → Deploy → Verify
Time: ~5 minutes from push to deployment
```

#### Production Environment (Manual Approval)
```yaml
Service: lobbyist-registration
Trigger: Manual approval on push to 'main' branch
Approval: Required (you review and approve)
Purpose: Stable, auditable production releases
Pipeline: Validate → Build → APPROVE → Migrate → Deploy → Verify
Time: ~10 minutes (including approval review)
```

---

## Key Benefits

### For Development
✅ **Fast feedback loop** - Push to develop, auto-deploys in 5 minutes
✅ **Catch issues early** - Type checking and security scans before deployment
✅ **No manual steps** - Fully automated from git push to deployment
✅ **Low risk** - Development environment, not public-facing

### For Production
✅ **Approval gates** - Manual review before every production deployment
✅ **Comprehensive audit trail** - Who, what, when, why, how (all logged)
✅ **Safe database migrations** - Automated Prisma migrations before code deployment
✅ **Easy rollback** - Tagged images for quick rollback to any previous version
✅ **Blue-green deployment** - Zero-downtime releases with health checks
✅ **Government compliance** - Meets audit and accountability requirements

### For Operations
✅ **Cost-effective** - $0-10/month (within Cloud Build free tier)
✅ **GCP-native** - No external dependencies, no credentials in GitHub
✅ **Scalable** - Supports team growth and increased deployment frequency
✅ **Flexible** - Can add tests, security scans, performance checks, etc.

### Expected Usage Breakdown
```
Development deployments:
- 2-3 per day × 5 min each = 300-450 min/month
- Cost: $0

Production deployments:
- 1-2 per week × 7 min each = 28-56 min/month
- Cost: $0

Total: 328-506 build-minutes/month
Total cost: $0 (within free tier of 3,600 min)
```

### Comparison to Alternatives
| Method | Monthly Cost | Time Saved | Risk Level | Audit Trail |

- **Cloud Build:** Service accounts, Secret Manager, GCP-native ✅

---

## Compliance & Audit Trail

### What Gets Logged (Cloud Build)
Cloud Build provides comprehensive audit trails required for government systems:

```yaml
Deployment Record:
  Who:
    - GitHub user who pushed commit
    - GCP service account that executed build
    - Who approved production deployment (if applicable)

  What:
    - Complete git diff (all code changes)
    - Build artifacts (container images with SHA)
    - Configuration changes (environment variables, etc.)

  When:
    - Build start timestamp
    - Each build step completion time
    - Approval timestamp (production only)
    - Deployment completion timestamp

  Why:
    - Git commit message
    - Pull request description (if applicable)
    - Build trigger reason

  How:
    - Complete build logs (every command executed)
    - Test results (pass/fail)
    - Security scan results
    - Deployment verification results

  Result:
    - Success or failure status
    - Error messages (if failed)
    - Deployed revision ID
    - Service URL

Storage: 90 days in Cloud Logging (exportable for longer retention)
Export: JSON/CSV format for compliance reports
Access: Cloud Console, gcloud CLI, Logging API
```

### Compliance Features
✅ **NIST SP 800-53 controls** - Audit and accountability (AU family)
✅ **FedRAMP equivalents** - Change management and deployment controls
✅ **Multnomah County requirements** - Accountability and transparency
✅ **SOC 2 Type II** - Change management and deployment procedures

## Alternatives Considered & Rejected

### ❌ Cloud Run "Connect Repo"
**Rejected because:**
- No approval gates (instant production deployments)
- No pre-deployment validation
- Insufficient audit trail
- No database migration support
- Not suitable for government compliance

### ⚠️ GitHub Actions
**Considered but not chosen because:**
- GCP credentials stored in GitHub (external platform)
- Audit trail split between GitHub and GCP
- Less GCP-native than Cloud Build
- Acceptable for some use cases, but Cloud Build is better for GCP-only deployments

### ⚠️ Cloud Deploy
**Considered but not chosen because:**
- Overkill for current needs (designed for complex multi-environment pipelines)
- More expensive
- Higher complexity
- Cloud Build is simpler and sufficient for this project

### ❌ Manual Deployment (Current)
**Must be replaced because:**
- Doesn't scale with increased deployment frequency
- Error-prone (easy to forget steps)
- No automated testing before deployment
- Time-consuming (blocks development)
- Insufficient audit trail

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Do I need to stop using manual deployments completely?**
A: No! Cloud Build triggers are additive. You can always deploy manually if needed (emergencies, Cloud Build outage, etc.).

**Q: What if I push to main by accident?**
A: No problem! Production requires manual approval. Just don't approve the build, or cancel it in the Cloud Build console.

**Q: How do I test Cloud Build without actually deploying?**
A: Use `gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild-dev.yaml --no-source` to test the build pipeline locally.

**Q: What about database migrations with SQLite?**
A: SQLite is ephemeral in Cloud Run (resets on deployment). Migration steps will be added when you migrate to Cloud SQL.

**Q: Can I customize the build pipeline later?**
A: Yes! Edit `cloudbuild-dev.yaml` and `cloudbuild-prod.yaml` anytime. Changes take effect immediately.

**Q: What happens if Cloud Build is down?**
A: Fall back to manual deployment using `gcloud run deploy`. Cloud Build has >99.9% uptime.

**Q: How do I add other team members as approvers?**
A: Grant them the `roles/cloudbuild.builds.approver` IAM role in your GCP project.

**Q: Is this overkill for a prototype?**
A: Not anymore! You're moving to production (June 2026 launch). Cloud Build provides essential safety for government systems.

**Q: What about Terraform?**
A: Cloud Build can deploy Terraform configs too. Add Terraform steps to the build pipeline when ready.

**Q: Can I see an example of a failed build?**
A: Yes! Push a commit with TypeScript errors to `develop`. Cloud Build will fail the type-check step and show clear error messages.
