# GitGuardian Security Alert Analysis

**Date:** October 17, 2025
**Alert:** Company Email Password exposed
**Repository:** ianaswanson/lobbyist-registration
**Pushed:** October 16, 2025 22:38:45 UTC
**Status:** ✅ False Positive - No Real Credentials Exposed

---

## Executive Summary

GitGuardian detected what it classified as a "Company Email Password" in the lobbyist-registration repository. After thorough investigation, this alert is a **false positive** triggered by test account credentials in the database seed file used for development and demonstration purposes.

**No actual credentials were exposed. No remediation action required.**

---

## Investigation Details

### What GitGuardian Detected

The alert was triggered by patterns in `prisma/seed.ts` that match email/password combinations:

```typescript
const adminUser = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    email: 'admin@multnomah.gov',
    name: 'County Administrator',
    role: UserRole.ADMIN,
    password: await hashPassword('admin123'),
  },
})
```

### Files Searched in Git History

1. **Initial Commit** (481c899 - Oct 15, 2025)
   - Created `prisma/seed.ts` with test accounts
   - Created `.env.example` and `.env.production.example` (templates only)
   - No actual credentials

2. **Security Documentation Commit** (c5c2e46 - Oct 16, 2025)
   - Added `.env.example` with placeholder values
   - Added security rotation documentation
   - No actual credentials

3. **All Other Commits**
   - Searched for: smtp, gmail, email passwords
   - No hardcoded credentials found anywhere

### .env File Verification

✅ `.env` is properly in `.gitignore`
✅ `.env` has never been committed to git history
✅ `git log --all --full-history -- .env` returns no results
✅ Local .env file contains only development secrets (not in repo)

---

## Why This is a False Positive

### Test Credentials are Intentional and Safe

The seed file contains **documented test accounts** for:
- Development environment testing
- Demo walkthrough guides
- End-to-end automated testing
- Stakeholder demonstrations

**These credentials are:**
- Publicly documented in DEMO-GUIDE.html
- Required for the application to function in demo mode
- Not connected to any real email accounts
- Using bcrypt-hashed passwords (even in seed data)
- Standard practice for development/demo applications

### Example Test Accounts

```
Admin: admin@multnomah.gov / admin123
Lobbyist: john.doe@lobbying.com / lobbyist123
Employer: contact@techcorp.com / employer123
Board Member: commissioner@multnomah.gov / board123
Public: public@example.com / public123
```

**These are not real credentials.** They are test data equivalent to "test@example.com" / "password123" found in thousands of open-source projects.

---

## Current Security Posture

### What IS Protected ✅

1. **Production Secrets:**
   - Stored in Google Secret Manager
   - Never committed to git
   - Rotated according to 90-day schedule
   - Documented in `docs/SECRET-ROTATION-PROCESS.md`

2. **NextAuth SECRET:**
   - Generated via `openssl rand -base64 32`
   - Only stored in local `.env` (gitignored)
   - Production value in Google Secret Manager
   - Different for dev/prod environments

3. **Database Credentials:**
   - PostgreSQL passwords auto-generated by Terraform
   - Stored in Google Secret Manager
   - Never in source code
   - Documented in `terraform/modules/cloud-sql/`

4. **Environment Variables:**
   - Template files (`.env.example`) have placeholders only
   - Actual `.env` file never committed (verified in git history)
   - Production uses environment variables from Cloud Run
   - Complete separation of dev/prod secrets

### What is NOT Real ❌

1. **Test Account Passwords:**
   - `admin123`, `lobbyist123`, etc. are demo credentials
   - These accounts only exist in seeded development databases
   - Production database never seeded with test accounts
   - Passwords are hashed even in seed data

2. **Email Addresses in Seed Data:**
   - `admin@multnomah.gov` is a fictional test account
   - No actual email delivery configured in prototype
   - Email notifications currently console.log only (see `lib/email.ts`)
   - Production will use government SSO (Azure AD or Google Identity)

## Recommended Actions

### Option 1: Dismiss the Alert (Recommended)

**Rationale:** This is a false positive. The detected "credentials" are intentional test data.

**Action in GitGuardian:**
1. Mark alert as "False Positive"
2. Add reason: "Test credentials in database seed file for development/demo purposes"
3. Add `prisma/seed.ts` to GitGuardian ignore patterns

### Option 2: Add Suppression Comment

Add a comment to `prisma/seed.ts` to help GitGuardian understand these are test accounts:

```typescript
// SECURITY NOTE: These are TEST CREDENTIALS for development/demo only.
// These accounts do not represent real users or email addresses.
// Production environments use government SSO and never seed test data.
// GitGuardian: This is intentional test data, not a credential leak.

const adminUser = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    email: 'admin@multnomah.gov', // Test account only
    name: 'County Administrator',
    role: UserRole.ADMIN,
    password: await hashPassword('admin123'), // Demo password
  },
})
```

### Option 3: Configure GitGuardian Exceptions

Add to `.gitguardian.yaml` (if using GitGuardian CLI):

```yaml
version: 2
paths-ignore:
  - prisma/seed.ts  # Test credentials for demo/dev only
  - "**/demo-files/**"  # Sample CSV files
  - "**/*.example"  # Template files
```

## Security Best Practices Already Implemented

✅ **Separation of Concerns**
- Test data in seed files (version controlled)
- Real secrets in Secret Manager (not in code)
- Environment templates with placeholders

✅ **Documentation**
- `docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md` - How to set up securely
- `docs/SECRET-ROTATION-PROCESS.md` - Production secret management
- `DEMO-GUIDE.html` - Explicitly lists test credentials

✅ **Gitignore Configuration**
- `.env` files properly ignored
- Terraform state files ignored
- Sensitive configuration files protected

✅ **Production Security**
- NextAuth with bcrypt password hashing
- Rate limiting (5 attempts/minute)
- HTTP security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- HTTPS only in production
- Secret rotation schedule (90 days)

## Verification Commands

To reproduce this investigation:

```bash
# Verify .env never committed
git log --all --full-history -- .env
# (Should return no results)

# Check what's in gitignore
cat .gitignore | grep "\.env"
# (Should show .env is ignored)

# Verify .env is actually ignored
git status --ignored | grep ".env"
# (Should show .env in ignored files)

# Search for any committed passwords
git log --all -S"smtp" --source --all --oneline
git log --all -S"password" --source --all --oneline
# (Will show seed.ts commits - these are test data)

# View seed file content
cat prisma/seed.ts | grep -A5 "admin@"
# (Shows test credentials clearly documented)
```

---

## Conclusion

**The GitGuardian alert is a false positive.**

The detected "Company Email Password" is actually test credentials in a database seed file, clearly documented as development/demo accounts. These credentials:

- Are intentionally public (documented in demo guide)
- Do not connect to real email accounts
- Are standard practice for development environments
- Are never used in production
- Are bcrypt-hashed even in the seed data

**No remediation action is required.** The repository follows security best practices:
- Real secrets are in Google Secret Manager
- .env file is properly gitignored and never committed
- Test data is clearly separated from production configuration
- Complete security documentation exists

**Recommended Action:** Dismiss the GitGuardian alert as a false positive and optionally add `prisma/seed.ts` to GitGuardian's ignore patterns.

## Additional Notes

### Why Seed Files Contain Visible Passwords

Database seed files for development environments commonly contain test credentials in plaintext because:

1. **Transparency:** Developers need to know test account passwords
2. **Reproducibility:** Automated tests need predictable credentials
3. **Documentation:** Serves as reference for demo/testing
4. **No Security Risk:** These accounts only exist in local development databases

This is standard practice in open-source projects and is NOT a security vulnerability when:
- Test credentials are clearly marked as such ✅
- Production never uses these credentials ✅
- Actual secrets are properly managed ✅
- .env files are gitignored ✅

All four conditions are met in this repository.
