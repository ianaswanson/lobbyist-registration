  - 5 roles: PUBLIC, LOBBYIST, EMPLOYER, BOARD_MEMBER, ADMIN
  - Secure password storage (bcrypt hashed)

#### Lobbyist Registration
- **Lobbyist** - Lobbyist profiles with registration tracking
- **Employer** - Employer/organization profiles
- **LobbyistEmployer** - Many-to-many relationship with authorization documents

#### Quarterly Reporting
- **LobbyistExpenseReport** - Lobbyist quarterly expense submissions
- **EmployerExpenseReport** - Employer quarterly expense submissions
- **ExpenseLineItem** - Itemized expenses >$50 (shared by both report types)
- **EmployerLobbyistPayment** - Track payments to each lobbyist

#### Board Member Tracking
- **BoardMember** - County board member profiles
- **BoardCalendarEntry** - Quarterly calendar events
- **BoardLobbyingReceipt** - Lobbying expenses received by board members

#### Compliance & Enforcement
- **Violation** - Track violations with fines up to $500
  - 7 violation types (late registration, false statements, etc.)
  - 6 status states (pending → issued → appealed → decided)
- **Appeal** - 30-day appeal process with hearing scheduling

#### Contract Regulation
- **ContractException** - Track 1-year cooling-off period exceptions

#### Audit Trail
- **AuditLog** - Complete audit trail (who, what, when, where)

**Key Features:**
- ✅ All ordinance requirements mapped to database schema
- ✅ Proper relationships with cascade deletes
- ✅ Indexes on frequently queried fields
- ✅ Enums for status/type fields (type safety)
- ✅ Timestamps on all records (created, updated)
- ✅ Optional fields where appropriate (NULL handling)

**Files Created:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Complete database schema (412 lines)
- `prisma/migrations/20251015145346_init/` - Initial migration
- `prisma/dev.db` - SQLite database file

### 3. Authentication System (Issue #4) ✅

**NextAuth.js v5 Configuration:**
- JWT session strategy (stateless, scalable)
- Credentials provider (email + password)
- Prisma adapter for database integration
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- bcrypt password hashing (10 salt rounds)

**Security Features:**
- ✅ Secure password hashing
- ✅ JWT tokens with user ID + role
- ✅ Protected route middleware
- ✅ Public routes exempted (search, view pages)
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ CSRF protection (Next.js built-in)

**Authentication Flow:**
1. User submits credentials on `/auth/signin`
2. Server validates email/password against database
3. bcrypt compares hashed passwords
4. JWT token generated with user ID + role
5. Token stored in session cookie
6. Middleware validates token on protected routes
7. Redirect to dashboard or requested page

**Pages Created:**
- `/auth/signin` - Sign-in form with email/password
- `/auth/error` - Authentication error page
- `/dashboard` - Protected dashboard (shows user info + role)

**Files Created:**
- `lib/auth.ts` - NextAuth configuration (JWT, providers, callbacks)
- `lib/password.ts` - Password hashing utilities
- `middleware.ts` - Route protection logic
- `types/next-auth.d.ts` - TypeScript type extensions
- `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - API route handler
- `app/auth/signin/page.tsx` - Sign-in page
- `app/auth/error/page.tsx` - Error page
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Dashboard page
- `.env` - Environment variables (AUTH_SECRET, DATABASE_URL)

**Environment Variables:**
```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
AUTH_SECRET="lobbyist-registration-dev-secret-change-in-production"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

---

## Blocked Issues (3)

These issues depend on features we haven't built yet:

- **#9**: Create CSV template for expense upload (blocked by #8)
- **#10**: Build CSV upload and validation workflow (blocked by #8)
- **#15**: Build public data export (CSV download) (blocked by #14)

---

## Technical Decisions Made

### 1. **Migration-Based Schema Management**
- **Decision:** All database changes go through Prisma migrations
- **Rationale:** Prevents "vibe coding" where schema becomes unpredictable
- **Benefit:** Clear history, rollback capability, production safety

### 2. **JWT Session Strategy**
- **Decision:** Use JWT tokens instead of database sessions
- **Rationale:** Stateless, scalable, no database hits on every request
- **Trade-off:** Can't immediately revoke sessions (need token expiry)

### 3. **Role-Based Access Control**
- **Decision:** 5 distinct user roles in database schema
- **Rationale:** Ordinance clearly defines different user types with different permissions
- **Implementation:** Role stored in JWT, checked in middleware

### 4. **SQLite for Prototype, PostgreSQL for Production**
- **Decision:** Start with SQLite, migrate to PostgreSQL later
- **Rationale:** Zero infrastructure setup for rapid prototyping
- **Migration Path:** Prisma supports PostgreSQL with same schema (just change DATABASE_URL)

### 5. **Credentials Provider for MVP**
- **Decision:** Email/password authentication for prototype
- **Future:** Will add Azure AD/Google SSO for government deployment
- **Rationale:** Fastest path to working authentication

---

## What's Working Right Now

You can test the application:

1. **Start the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Visit:** `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Test authentication:**
   - Visit `/dashboard` (will redirect to sign-in)
   - Note: No users exist yet, so sign-in will fail
   - We need to create seed data (Issue #19) to test full flow

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Session)
1. **Decision Point:** Continue building features OR pause for review
2. If continuing, recommend starting with:
   - Issue #19: Create seed data (so we can test auth)
   - Issue #6: Multi-step registration wizard (core feature)

### Short-Term Goals (Next Session)
1. Build core registration flow (#6 + #7)
2. Build expense reporting (#8 + #9 + #10)
3. Build public search interface (#14 + #15)
4. Build admin dashboard (#16 + #17)

### Medium-Term Goals (This Week)
1. Complete all MVP features (Issues #6-#18)
2. Add test data and demo the system
3. Get stakeholder feedback

---

## Project Health

---

## Questions to Consider

1. **Continue building features now?**
   - We can knock out several more features this session
   - Recommend: Issue #19 (seed data) so we can test auth

2. **Demo readiness?**
   - We can show: architecture, database schema, auth flow
   - We cannot show: working registration or reporting (not built yet)

3. **Stakeholder demo timeline?**
   - When do you want to show this to stakeholders?
   - What features are must-haves for first demo?

4. **Team capacity?**
   - Is this a good stopping point for today?
   - Or should we keep building features?
