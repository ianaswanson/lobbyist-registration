# Session Summary - Database Seeding & Production Process Update
**Date:** October 17, 2025
**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Focus:** Fix SQLite database seeding on Cloud Run deployments

---

## 🎯 Session Objective

**User Question:** "Every time we deploy, there's no information in the database. We need to fix our process."

**Root Cause:** SQLite databases are ephemeral on Cloud Run - even baked-in databases from Docker build don't persist.

**Solution:** Implement runtime database seeding that auto-populates on container startup.

---

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Runtime Seeding Implementation
**Created:**
- `scripts/startup.sh` - Intelligent startup script that checks for empty database and seeds automatically
- Updated `Dockerfile` - Switched from build-time to runtime seeding
- `cloud-run-service.yaml` - Cloud Run configuration with proper health probes

**How It Works:**
1. Container starts → startup script runs
2. Checks if database exists and has data
3. If empty → runs `npx prisma migrate deploy` + `npm run db:seed`
4. If populated → skips seeding (idempotent)
5. Starts Next.js server

### 2. Development Environment - COMPLETE ✅
**Deployed via Terraform:**
- Service: `lobbyist-registration-dev`
- URL: https://lobbyist-registration-dev-679888289147.us-west1.run.app
- Database: SQLite (auto-seeded on startup)
- Status: Fully functional, tested and verified

### 3. Production Environment - UPDATED ✅
**Deployed with runtime seeding:**
- Service: `lobbyist-registration`
- URL: https://lobbyist-registration-679888289147.us-west1.run.app
- Database: SQLite (auto-seeded on startup)
- Container: Built and deployed with new runtime seeding
- Status: Working, database auto-populates

### 4. Production Terraform Config - CREATED 📋
**Prepared but not yet applied:**
- Location: `terraform/environments/prod/`
- Files: main.tf, variables.tf, backend.tf, outputs.tf, terraform.tfvars
- Import script: `import-existing.sh`
- Ready for full Terraform management (next session)

### 5. Documentation Created
- `RUNTIME-SEEDING-IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Technical implementation details
- `DEV-ENVIRONMENT.md` - Quick reference for dev environment
- `PRODUCTION-STATUS.md` - Complete production system overview
- `SESSION-SUMMARY-2025-10-17-Runtime-Seeding.md` - Runtime seeding session
- `SESSION-SUMMARY-2025-10-17-Production-Migration.md` - Production update session
- `terraform/environments/prod/DEPLOYMENT-NOTES.md` - Terraform migration guide

---

## 📊 Current Status

### Both Environments Now Use Runtime Seeding ✅

| Environment | Status | URL | Database | Terraform |
|-------------|--------|-----|----------|-----------|
| **Dev** | ✅ Working | lobbyist-registration-dev | SQLite (auto-seed) | Fully managed |
| **Prod** | ✅ Working | lobbyist-registration | SQLite (auto-seed) | Config ready |

### Test Accounts (Auto-Created on Startup)
- **Admin:** admin@multnomah.gov / admin123
- **Lobbyist:** john.doe@lobbying.com / lobbyist123
- **Employer:** contact@techcorp.com / employer123
- **Board Member:** commissioner@multnomah.gov / board123
- **Public:** public@example.com / public123

## 🔄 What's Next (Not Completed This Session)

### Full Terraform Migration for Production
**User requested but session ended before completion:**

```bash
cd terraform/environments/prod
terraform init
terraform import google_cloud_run_service.app \
  projects/lobbyist-475218/locations/us-west1/services/lobbyist-registration
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

**Decision Point:** Stay with SQLite or migrate to Cloud SQL PostgreSQL?
- **Option A:** Keep SQLite (working great, simple, free)
- **Option B:** Migrate to PostgreSQL (persistent, production-grade, ~$10/month)

**Note:** All Terraform configs are ready. Just need to run the commands when ready.

---

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### SQLite on Cloud Run
- **Ephemeral** - Resets on every container restart
- **Works with runtime seeding** - Auto-populates in <2 seconds
- **Good for demos** - Fresh data every deploy
- **Not production-grade** - Use Cloud SQL for real production

### Runtime vs Build-Time Seeding
**Build-Time (Original approach):**
❌ Database baked into image during build
❌ Still gets lost due to Cloud Run filesystem behavior
❌ Unreliable

**Runtime (New approach):**
✅ Database created on container startup
✅ Works reliably every time
✅ Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
✅ Logs show seeding status

### Infrastructure as Code Benefits
- **Dev environment:** Fully Terraform-managed, reproducible
- **Prod environment:** Config ready, just needs `terraform apply`
- **Version control:** All infrastructure changes tracked in git
- **Consistency:** Dev and prod use identical configurations

## 💡 Recommendations for Next Session

### 1. Complete Terraform Migration (5 minutes)
Run the Terraform commands to bring production under full IaC management.

### 2. Decision: SQLite vs PostgreSQL
**If staying with SQLite:**
- ✅ No changes needed
- ✅ Everything works
- ✅ Free
- ⚠️ Data resets on deploy (but auto-seeds)

**If migrating to PostgreSQL:**
- Fix Prisma schema constraints (add `map` attributes)
- Run migrations against Cloud SQL
- Update DATABASE_URL
- Test data persistence
- ~1-2 hours of work

### 3. Commit Everything to Git
All the new files and changes should be committed:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Implement runtime database seeding for Cloud Run

- Add startup script that auto-seeds database on container start
- Update Dockerfile for runtime seeding instead of build-time
- Deploy to both dev and production environments
- Create production Terraform configuration (ready to apply)
- Add comprehensive documentation

Fixes: Database empty after Cloud Run deploys
"
git push origin main
```

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Before This Session
- ❌ Database empty after every deploy
- ❌ Manual seeding required
- ❌ Production not Terraform-managed
- ❌ Different processes for dev and prod

### After This Session
- ✅ Database auto-populates on every deploy
- ✅ Zero manual intervention needed
- ✅ Dev fully Terraform-managed
- ✅ Prod Terraform config ready to apply
- ✅ Identical process for both environments
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

---

## 🚀 Quick Reference

### Deploy to Development (Terraform)
```bash
cd terraform/environments/dev
terraform apply
```

### Deploy to Production (Current Method)
```bash
gcloud builds submit --tag us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/lobbyist-475218/lobbyist-registry/lobbyist-registration:latest
gcloud run deploy lobbyist-registration \
  --image us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/lobbyist-475218/lobbyist-registry/lobbyist-registration:latest \
  --region us-west1
```

### Deploy to Production (After Terraform Migration)
```bash
cd terraform/environments/prod
terraform apply
```

### Check Logs (Verify Seeding)
```bash
# Development
gcloud run services logs read lobbyist-registration-dev --region us-west1

# Production
gcloud run services logs read lobbyist-registration --region us-west1
```

Look for:
```
🌱 Database is empty or missing - initializing...
✅ Database seeding completed successfully!
```
