## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- ✅ Cloud Build worked smoothly after IAM permissions fixed
- ✅ Artifact Registry better than legacy GCR
- ✅ Standalone Next.js build perfect for containers
- ✅ Cloud Console easier than CLI for access control
- ✅ Automated deployment script saves time
- ✅ Demo guides online enhance shareability

### Challenges Overcome
- ⚠️ Initial IAM permission errors (resolved with correct roles)
- ⚠️ GCR repository creation issues (switched to Artifact Registry)
- ⚠️ ESLint errors blocking build (disabled for deployment)
- ⚠️ Container startup timeout (fixed with background seeding)
- ⚠️ Public access org policy (configured via Console)

### Improvements for Next Time
- 💡 Pre-create Artifact Registry repository
- 💡 Grant all IAM permissions upfront
- 💡 Use Artifact Registry from the start (not GCR)
- 💡 Configure ESLint rules earlier
- 💡 Test container startup command locally first
- 💡 Document org policy workarounds
