# Session Summary: Cloud Build Automated Deployment Setup - October 21, 2025

## Overview
Set up Google Cloud Build Triggers for automated deployment from GitHub with approval gates for government compliance.

## Decision: Cloud Build Triggers vs. "Connect Repo"

User asked whether to use Google Cloud Run's "Connect Repository" feature. After GCP SRE specialist analysis, we chose **Cloud Build Triggers** instead.

**Why Cloud Build Triggers Won:**
- ✅ Manual approval gates for production deployments (government compliance)
- ✅ Pre-deployment validation and testing
- ✅ Complete audit trail for all deployments
- ✅ Database migration support (future)
- ✅ Easy rollback procedures
- ✅ Separate dev/prod workflows

**Why Not "Connect Repo":**
- ❌ No approval gates - any push deploys immediately
- ❌ No pre-deployment testing
- ❌ Limited audit trail
- ❌ No migration support
- ❌ Single workflow for all branches

## Files Created

### Cloud Build Configuration (2 files)
1. **cloudbuild-dev.yaml** (3,482 bytes)
   - Development environment auto-deployment
   - Triggers on `develop` branch
   - No approval required

2. **cloudbuild-prod.yaml** (8,001 bytes)
   - Production environment deployment
   - Triggers on `main` branch
   - **Requires manual approval** before deployment

### Deployment Documentation (8 files)
1. **DEPLOYMENT-RECOMMENDATION.md** - Complete strategy guide
2. **DEPLOYMENT-WORKFLOW.md** - Daily operations reference
3. **DEPLOYMENT-STRATEGY.md** - Detailed procedures
4. **DEPLOYMENT-OPTIONS-COMPARISON.md** - Compare all methods
5. **DEPLOYMENT-INDEX.md** - Navigation guide
6. **README-DEPLOYMENT.md** - Quick start guide
7. **deployment-architecture.txt** - Visual diagrams
8. **setup-cloud-build-triggers.sh** - Automated setup script

## Setup Process

### Automated Script Partial Success
Ran `./setup-cloud-build-triggers.sh` which successfully:
- ✅ Enabled Cloud Build API
- ✅ Created logs bucket: `gs://lobbyist-475218_cloudbuild_logs`
- ✅ Configured service account permissions:
  - `roles/run.admin` - Deploy Cloud Run services
  - `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` - Act as service account
- ❌ Failed to create triggers (GitHub not connected yet)

### Manual Trigger Creation (Cloud Console UI)
Created triggers manually through https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers

**Trigger 1: Production**
- Name: `deploy-lobbyist-prod`
- Branch: `^main$`
- Config: `cloudbuild-prod.yaml`
- **Approval: Required** ✅
- Service Account: `679888289147-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`

**Trigger 2: Development**
- Name: `deploy-lobbyist-dev`
- Branch: `^develop$`
- Config: `cloudbuild-dev.yaml`
- Approval: Not required (auto-deploy)
- Service Account: `679888289147-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`

## Challenges Encountered

### 1. Authentication Token Expiration
**Error**: `Reauthentication failed. cannot prompt during non-interactive execution.`

**Fix**: Ran `gcloud auth login` to refresh credentials

### 2. GitHub Repository Not Connected
**Error**: `INVALID_ARGUMENT: Request contains an invalid argument.`

**Fix**: Manually connected repository via Cloud Build Console:
1. Navigate to Cloud Build Triggers
2. Click "Connect Repository"
3. Select "GitHub (Cloud Build GitHub App)"
4. Authorize and select: `ianaswanson/lobbyist-registration`

### 3. CLI Syntax Issues
**Error**: gcloud CLI trigger creation commands failed with syntax errors

**Fix**: Created triggers manually through Cloud Console UI instead of CLI

### 4. User Navigation Confusion
**Issue**: User initially on Cloud Run "Create Service" page instead of Cloud Build Triggers

**Fix**: Clarified navigation difference between:
- Cloud Run "Connect Repo" (❌ don't use)
- Cloud Build Triggers (✅ use this)

## Architecture

```
GitHub Repository (ianaswanson/lobbyist-registration)
│
├── Branch: develop
│   └── Push triggers → deploy-lobbyist-dev (AUTO)
│       ├── Build Docker image
│       ├── Run tests (future)
│       └── Deploy to Cloud Run (dev)
│
└── Branch: main
    └── Push triggers → deploy-lobbyist-prod (MANUAL APPROVAL)
        ├── Build Docker image
        ├── Run tests (future)
        ├── ⏸️  Wait for admin approval
        └── Deploy to Cloud Run (prod)
```

## Benefits

### Government Compliance
- Manual approval gates for production changes
- Complete audit trail of all deployments
- Who deployed what, when, and why
- Easy compliance reporting

### Developer Efficiency
- Auto-deploy to dev on every push to `develop`
- No manual deployment steps
- Saves 2+ hours/month vs manual deployment

### Safety
- Pre-deployment validation (future)
- Database migration support (future)
- Easy rollback procedures
- Separate dev/prod environments prevent mistakes

### Cost
- Free tier covers ~100 builds/day
- Expected cost: $0-10/month
- Within Google Cloud free tier limits

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)
1. ✅ Create session summary
2. ⏳ Commit all uncommitted changes
3. ⏳ Create `develop` branch
4. ⏳ Test deployment workflow

### Testing Deployment
1. Create small test change
2. Push to `develop` branch
3. Watch Cloud Build auto-deploy to dev environment
4. Verify deployment at dev URL
5. Monitor build logs for issues

### Future Enhancements
1. Add automated tests to build pipeline
2. Add database migration step
3. Add deployment notifications (Slack/email)
4. Add performance monitoring
5. Add automated rollback on failure

## Files Modified (This Session)
- Created 10 new deployment configuration and documentation files
- No code changes to application

## Commits Made
- `2193603` - "DevOps: Add Cloud Build automated deployment infrastructure"

## Session Duration
~90 minutes

## Key Commands

```bash
# View triggers
gcloud builds triggers list

# View builds
gcloud builds list --limit=10

# View build logs
gcloud builds log <BUILD_ID>

# Watch build progress
https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds

# Test deployment
