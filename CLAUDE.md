- County Administrators (compliance monitoring)
- General Public (transparency dashboard)

## Development Approach

### Current Production Stack âœ…
**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes (monolithic)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Cloud SQL) with Prisma ORM
- **Auth:** NextAuth.js with secure session management
- **Secrets:** Google Cloud Secret Manager
- **Deployment:** Google Cloud Run (containerized with Docker)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions + Cloud Build Triggers
- **Error Tracking:** Sentry (with PII filtering)
- **Security:** Dependabot automated dependency updates
- **Infrastructure:** GCP (Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, Secret Manager, Cloud Build)

**Philosophy:** Production-ready government application with security, monitoring, and scalability

### Completed Modernization Phases (Oct 2025)
- **Phase 1:** Code Quality Foundation - Prettier, Husky, pre-commit hooks, build quality gates
- **Phase 2:** Testing Infrastructure - Vitest unit tests, 80% code coverage, component tests
- **Phase 3:** Production Infrastructure - PostgreSQL migration, GitHub Actions CI/CD, Dependabot
- **Phase 4:** Security & Monitoring - Sentry error tracking, Secret Manager, security documentation

### Future Enhancements (Phase 5+)
**Planned for Post-Launch:**
- Auth: NextAuth â†’ Government SSO (Azure AD or Google Identity)
- Storage: Local files â†’ Cloud Storage (GCS for document uploads)
- Infrastructure: Terraform for infrastructure-as-code
- Monitoring: Custom dashboards, advanced alerting
- Performance: CDN, caching strategies, query optimization

## Critical Development Rules

### Issue Tracking with Beads
**THIS PROJECT USES BEADS (`bd`) FOR ISSUE TRACKING**

Beads is initialized in `.beads/` directory. Use it for all task management instead of TodoWrite tool.

**Common Commands:**
```bash
# List all issues
bd list

# Create new issue
bd create "Issue title" --labels feature,mvp

# Show issue details
bd show <id>

# Update issue status
bd update <id> --status in-progress
bd update <id> --status done

# Mark dependencies (issue X blocks issue Y)
bd dep add <blocker-id> <blocked-id>

# Show ready work (no blockers)
bd ready

# Show blocked issues
bd blocked
```

**Issue Labels to Use:**
- `mvp` - Phase 1 must-have features
- `phase2` - Post-launch enhancements
- `phase3` - Future improvements
- `bug` - Defects to fix
- `feature` - New functionality
- `wireframe` - Implementing wireframe designs
- `database` - Database schema or migration work
- `ui` - Frontend/UI work
- `backend` - API/backend work
- `accessibility` - WCAG compliance work
- `documentation` - Docs and guides

**Workflow:**
1. Before starting work: `bd ready` to see available tasks
2. Pick an issue and mark in-progress: `bd update <id> --status in-progress`
3. Complete work and close: `bd close <id>`
4. Create new issues as discovered: `bd create "New task"`

### Database Management
**GOLDEN RULE: Schema changes ONLY through migration files**

```bash
# To change database schema
npm run prisma:migrate dev --name descriptive_name

# NEVER manually alter database
# NEVER modify schema without migration
# ALWAYS commit migration files
```

**Why:** Prevents "vibe coding" chaos where database structure becomes unpredictable.

## Working with Claude Code

### Before Starting Development
1. Check existing issues: `bd ready` or `bd list`
2. Review relevant wireframe in `wireframes/` directory
3. Review user story map: `user-story-map.html`
4. Read relevant ordinance section from PDF

### When Starting a New Feature
1. Create/find issue in Beads: `bd create "Feature name" --labels feature,mvp`
2. Mark as in-progress: `bd update <id> --status in-progress`
3. Reference wireframe if available (4 core screens have wireframes)
4. Create database migrations if needed
5. Build API routes following wireframe data requirements
6. Create UI components matching wireframe design
7. Test workflow end-to-end
8. Close issue: `bd close <id>`
9. Document any assumptions or deviations from wireframe

### When Making Schema Changes
```bash
# 1. Modify prisma/schema.prisma
# 2. Create migration
npm run prisma:migrate dev --name add_field_name
# 3. Update TypeScript types
npm run prisma:generate
# 4. Commit migration file
git add prisma/migrations/
```

### When Implementing Wireframes
Wireframes are in `wireframes/` and are interactive HTML with design notes:
- `01-lobbyist-registration.html` - Multi-step registration wizard
- `02-quarterly-expense-report.html` - Expense reporting with CSV upload
- `03-admin-compliance-dashboard.html` - Admin monitoring interface
- `04-public-search-interface.html` - Public transparency search

Each wireframe includes a "Design Notes" section at bottom explaining:
- Why certain approaches were chosen
- Alternative approaches considered
- Accessibility considerations
- Mobile responsiveness notes
- Future enhancements

**Use wireframes as specifications, not pixel-perfect mockups.** Focus on:
- Information architecture
- Field requirements from ordinance
- User workflow
- Validation rules
- Accessibility patterns

### Testing Approach
- Test with realistic data (use seed scripts)
- Validate all required fields from ordinance
- Test deadline calculations
- Test role-based access
- Test file uploads (registration, expense reports)
- Test CSV upload/import workflow
- Test public dashboard search with multiple filters
- Test accessibility (keyboard nav, screen readers)

## Ordinance Reference

The complete ordinance is located at:
`/Users/ianswanson/ai-dev/lobbyist-registration/Government_Accountably_Ordinance_4.2.25_-_CA_Approved.pdf`

Key sections:
- **Â§3.800** - Purpose and Policy
- **Â§3.801** - Definitions
- **Â§3.802** - Registration Requirements
- **Â§3.803** - Exemptions
- **Â§3.804** - Prohibited Conduct
- **Â§3.805** - Lobbyist Expense Statements
- **Â§3.806** - Employer Expense Statements
- **Â§3.807** - False Statement Penalties

## Design Principles

### User Experience
- **Simple first:** Start with basic workflows
- **Progressive disclosure:** Don't overwhelm users
- **Clear instructions:** Many users won't be tech-savvy
- **Helpful errors:** Guide users to fix problems
- **Confirmation messages:** Reassure users actions succeeded

### Data Model
- **Normalize properly:** Avoid data duplication
- **Track history:** Keep audit trail of changes
- **Soft deletes:** Never hard-delete data (compliance)
- **Timestamps:** created_at, updated_at on everything

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript strict mode:** Catch errors early
- **Component reuse:** Build once, use everywhere
- **Error boundaries:** Graceful failure handling
- **Loading states:** Never leave users hanging
- **Optimistic updates:** Feel fast even when slow

## Deployment Path

### Local Development

**Prerequisites:** Cloud SQL Proxy for PostgreSQL database access

```bash
# 1. Start Cloud SQL Proxy (in separate terminal)
cloud-sql-proxy lobbyist-475218:us-west1:lobbyist-registration-db --port=5432

# 2. Set DATABASE_URL for local development
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://lobbyist_user:PASSWORD@127.0.0.1:5432/lobbyist_dev"

# 3. Start Next.js dev server
npm run dev

# Other useful commands:
npm run prisma:studio    # View database with Prisma Studio
npm run prisma:seed      # Reseed database with Rule of 3 demo data
npm run db:reset         # Drop, recreate, migrate, and seed database
```

**Note:** Get the database password from Secret Manager:
```bash
gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret="lobbyist-db-url-dev"
```

### Development Environment (Cloud Run)
- **Auto-deploys** from `develop` branch via Cloud Build Triggers
- **URL:** https://lobbyist-registration-dev-zzp44w3snq-uw.a.run.app
- **Database:** Cloud SQL PostgreSQL (`lobbyist_dev`)
- **Purpose:** Testing and iteration

### Production Environment (Cloud Run)
- **Manual approval deploys** from `main` branch via Cloud Build Triggers
- **URL:** https://lobbyist-registration-zzp44w3snq-uw.a.run.app
- **Database:** Cloud SQL PostgreSQL (`lobbyist_prod`)
- **Purpose:** Live application for stakeholders

### Pre-Launch Checklist (Future)

## Notes for Claude Code

- This is a **data-intensive CRUD application** - your strength
- Requirements are **legally defined** - stick to ordinance text
- **Wireframes exist** - use them as specifications for the 4 core screens
- **User story map exists** - reference it for priorities and user flows
- **Government users** - prioritize clarity over cleverness
- **Public transparency** - assume all data may be public record
- **Long-term maintenance** - write maintainable, documented code
- **Accessibility is not optional** - it's a legal requirement
- **Use Beads (`bd`)** - all task tracking via Beads, not TodoWrite tool

When in doubt about a requirement, refer to:
1. Relevant wireframe (if available)
2. User story map for context
3. Ordinance PDF for legal requirements
4. PROJECT.md for comprehensive details
