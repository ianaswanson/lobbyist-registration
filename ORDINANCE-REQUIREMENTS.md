## NOTES ON ACCURACY

All requirements above are taken verbatim or directly paraphrased from the ordinance. The ordinance does NOT explicitly require:
- A searchable public database (though § 3.001(C) requires public posting)
- Email notifications (though deadlines create implicit need)
- CSV upload/bulk entry (convenience feature, not required)
- Admin dashboards (needed to administer program, not specified)

These are **implementation choices** to satisfy the ordinance's intent of "transparency and accountability."
