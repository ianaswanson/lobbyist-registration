# Session Summary: Phase 3 CI/CD Setup (COMPLETE)

**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Duration:** ~30 minutes
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Beads Issue:** lobbyist-registration-34 (READY TO CLOSE)

---

## Mission Accomplished

Successfully set up comprehensive **CI/CD infrastructure** with GitHub Actions and Dependabot, providing automated quality gates for all pull requests and automatic dependency updates.

---

## What We Built

### 1. PR Checks Workflow (`.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`)

Runs automatically on every pull request to `main` or `develop` branches.

**✅ Quality Checks Job:**
- **Code Formatting** - Prettier format check (`npm run format:check`)
- **Linting** - ESLint with 0 errors required (`npm run lint`)
- **Type Safety** - TypeScript type checking (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- **Unit Tests** - All 112 Vitest tests (`npm test`)
- **Coverage** - Code coverage report (`npm run test:coverage`)
- **Build** - Next.js production build verification (`npm run build`)
- **Coverage Upload** - Codecov integration (optional)

**✅ E2E Tests Job:**
- Playwright browser tests
- Runs in parallel with quality checks
- Uploads test reports as artifacts (30-day retention)

**✅ Summary Job:**
- Checks if all jobs passed
- Reports overall status

**Configuration:**
- Node.js 20 (LTS)
- NPM caching for fast installs
- Parallel job execution
- Artifact uploads for debugging

### 2. CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

Runs on every push to `main` or `develop` branches.

**What it does:**
- Same quality checks as PR workflow
- Monitors branch health
- Reports build sizes
- Uploads coverage to Codecov
- Can be manually triggered via workflow_dispatch

**Use cases:**
- Automatic: Monitors main/develop branch health
- Manual: Quick verification after hotfix

### 3. Dependabot Configuration (`.github/dependabot.yml`)

Automated dependency management.

**Schedule:** Weekly on Mondays at 9:00 AM

**NPM Package Updates:**
- Production dependencies (grouped minor/patch)
- Development dependencies (grouped minor/patch)
- Major version updates (separate PRs)
- Max 10 open PRs at a time

**Ignored Updates:**
- Next.js major versions (manual review)
- React major versions (manual review)
- React DOM major versions (manual review)

**GitHub Actions Updates:**
- Weekly checks for action version updates
- Keeps workflows using latest versions

**PR Configuration:**
- Auto-assigned to @ianaswanson
- Labels: `dependencies`, `automated`, `github-actions`
- Commit prefix: `deps:` or `ci:`

### 4. Documentation (`.github/README.md`)

Complete guide covering:
- Workflow overview
- How it works
- Setup instructions (Codecov, Slack)
- Troubleshooting guide
- Best practices
- Metrics (95.89% coverage, 112 tests)
- Security recommendations

## Verification Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Check CI Workflow Status

The CI workflow should be running now since we pushed to `develop`:

1. Go to: https://github.com/ianaswanson/lobbyist-registration/actions
2. Look for "CI" workflow
3. Should see: ⏳ Running or ✅ Completed

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Prettier format check passes
- ✅ ESLint passes (0 errors, 120 warnings OK)
- ✅ TypeScript type check passes
- ✅ 112 unit tests pass
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ Coverage uploaded (if Codecov token configured)

### 🔄 Step 2: Test PR Workflow (Next)

Create a test PR to verify pr-checks workflow:

```bash
# Create test branch
git checkout develop
git checkout -b test/verify-ci-workflow

# Make a trivial change
echo "# CI/CD Test" >> .github/CI-TEST.md

# Commit and push
git add .github/CI-TEST.md
git commit -m "test: Verify CI/CD workflows"
git push origin test/verify-ci-workflow

# Create PR on GitHub:
# - From: test/verify-ci-workflow
# - To: develop
# - Title: "Test: Verify CI/CD Workflows"
```

**Expected PR Checks:**
- ✅ quality-checks
- ✅ e2e-tests
- ✅ summary

### 📦 Step 3: Verify Dependabot (Next Monday)

Dependabot will start running next Monday at 9 AM:

1. Check for new PRs with label `dependencies`
2. Review grouped updates
3. Verify PR checks run automatically
4. Merge if tests pass

---

## Configuration Options

### Optional: Codecov Integration

To enable code coverage tracking:

1. **Sign up:** https://codecov.io
2. **Add repo:** Connect GitHub repository
3. **Get token:** Copy upload token
4. **Add secret:**
   - Go to: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Create: `CODECOV_TOKEN`
   - Paste: Token from Codecov
5. **Done:** Coverage will upload on next run

**Benefits:**
- Coverage trends over time
- PR coverage diffs
- Coverage badges for README

### Optional: Branch Protection

Enable for production-ready security:

1. **Go to:** Settings → Branches
2. **Add rule:** Branch name pattern: `main`
3. **Enable:**
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - ✅ Select: `quality-checks`, `e2e-tests`, `summary`
   - ✅ Require review from code owners (optional)
   - ✅ Dismiss stale pull request reviews when new commits are pushed
4. **Save**

**Result:** Cannot merge to main without passing all checks

### Optional: Slack Notifications

Get notified of failed builds:

1. Create Slack webhook: https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks
2. Add to GitHub secrets: `SLACK_WEBHOOK`
3. Add to ci.yml:

```yaml
- name: Notify Slack on failure
  if: failure()
  uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v1
  with:
    webhook-url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```

## Architecture Decisions

### ✅ Separate PR and CI Workflows

**Decision:** Two workflows instead of one
- `pr-checks.yml` - For pull requests
- `ci.yml` - For main/develop branches

**Rationale:**
- PR checks focus on validation
- CI checks monitor branch health
- Different triggers (pull_request vs push)
- Can add deployment steps to CI later

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Easier to maintain
- Different failure behaviors

### ✅ Parallel Job Execution

**Decision:** Run quality-checks and e2e-tests in parallel

**Rationale:**
- E2E tests are slow (~2-3 min)
- Quality checks are fast (~1-2 min)
- Can run simultaneously
- Total time = slowest job (not sum)

**Benefits:**
- Faster feedback (2-3 min vs 4-6 min)
- Better resource utilization
- Developer productivity

### ✅ Grouped Dependency Updates

**Decision:** Group minor/patch updates, separate major updates

**Rationale:**
- Minor/patch updates rarely break things
- Major updates need careful review
- Too many PRs = notification fatigue
- Grouped PRs easier to review

**Benefits:**
- Fewer PRs to review
- Clear separation of risk levels
- Faster minor updates
- Thorough major update review

### ✅ Ignore React/Next.js Major Updates

**Decision:** Manual review required for framework updates

**Rationale:**
- Breaking changes in frameworks
- Requires testing entire application
- Migration guides need review
- Timing of updates important

**Benefits:**
- Controlled framework updates
- Time to plan migrations
- Avoid surprise breaking changes

## Troubleshooting

### If CI Workflow Fails

**Check workflow run:**
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click failed workflow
3. Expand failed step
4. Read error message

**Common Issues:**

**Prettier format check failed:**
```bash
npm run format
git add .
git commit -m "style: format code"
git push
```

**ESLint errors:**
```bash
npm run lint
# Fix reported errors
```

**TypeScript errors:**
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
# Fix type errors
```

**Tests failing:**
```bash
npm test
# Fix failing tests
```

**Build failing:**
```bash
npm run build
# Fix build errors
```

**E2E tests failing:**
1. Download Playwright report artifact
2. View HTML report locally
3. Check screenshots/videos
4. Fix issues
