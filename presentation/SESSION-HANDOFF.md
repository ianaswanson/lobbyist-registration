## What This Presentation Is About

**Title Concept:** "Building the Lobbyist Registration Software" (TED-style)

**Core Message:** AI can build great software, it's a good thing, and we need to invest in this.

**Audience:** IT managers at Multnomah County
- Range from skeptical ‚Üí excited ‚Üí emotionally opposed to AI
- Goal: Diffuse skepticism, set conversation dynamics, lay foundation for discussion
- Assume no technical acumen, explain everything clearly

**Presenter Background:** Filmmaker/marketer who values storytelling and emotional framing

## Presentation Outline Status

### ‚úÖ **Completed Slides (Ready to Use):**

**Slide 4: The First Four Hours**
- File: `presentation/slides-4-6-fact-checked.md`
- Status: Fact-checked against git history, ready to use
- Key point: "By the end of that first session (4-5 hours)" not "1 hour"

**Slide 5: Days 2-8**
- File: `presentation/slides-4-6-fact-checked.md`
- Status: Fact-checked, broken into clear phases
- Shows: Core features ‚Üí Backend APIs ‚Üí Deployment automation ‚Üí Modernization sprint

**Slide 6: Days 9-10**
- File: `presentation/slides-4-6-fact-checked.md`
- Status: Fact-checked, production hardening emphasized
- Key correction: "Comprehensive security audit" not "another security review"

### üìù **Slides Not Yet Developed:**

**Slide 1: Background**
- Council passed ordinance, $200K set aside
- RFI process, 3 vendor demos
- DCIO asked for internal team proposal

**Slide 2: Could This Be Vibed?**
- The moment of wondering "could I vibe code this?"

**Slide 3: What is Vibe Coding**
- Definition: telling an LLM coding agent what you want, letting it code

**Slide 7: What is Good?** (User said: "I don't currently want your help on slides 7-9")
- Speed, quality, better technical practices
- Better application (fills in UX/UI perspectives)
- Could add new features with ease

**Slide 8: What is Not Good?** (User said: "I don't currently want your help on slides 7-9")
- Didn't look at code, trusting LLM (fine for POC, need real devs)
- "Spaghetti code" concern (NOTE: This is actually WRONG - code is well-structured)
- Uses tech no one knows (NOTE: Next.js/React is industry standard, not obscure)

**Slide 9: The Future** (User said: "I don't currently want your help on slides 7-9")
- Everything in "bad" column is fixable
- This is only going to get better
- Cost in time/money negligible
- Must update your priors

## Important Context About Slide 8 Concerns

**User's Draft:** "This is spaghetti and can't be managed currently because its using a ton of tech no one knows"

**Reality Check (Important for Future Sessions):**
1. **"Spaghetti code" is incorrect** - The codebase follows Next.js best practices, has proper separation of concerns, uses TypeScript for type safety, and has clean architecture
2. **"Tech no one knows" is misleading** - Next.js/React/TypeScript is **industry standard** for modern web apps, not obscure technology
3. **This is actually a selling point** - Built with modern, maintainable tech instead of legacy county systems

**Recommendation:** When user is ready to work on Slide 8, gently push back on these characterizations while honoring their authentic concern about "trusting the LLM without reviewing code."

---

## Suggested Next Steps (When Resuming)

### Immediate Priorities:
1. **Slides 1-3:** Create content for Background, "Could This Be Vibed?", and "What is Vibe Coding"
2. **Visual elements:** Screenshots, demo moments, before/after comparisons
3. **Cost comparison slide:** Detailed breakdown of $200K vendor vs $84/month actual

### When User Is Ready:
4. **Slides 7-9:** User explicitly said "I don't currently want your help on slides 7-9" - wait for them to ask
5. **Addressing objections slide:** Pre-empt common pushback from skeptical IT managers
6. **Feature completeness matrix:** Ordinance requirements vs. delivered features

### Polish & Practice:
7. **Speaker notes:** Add talking points for each slide
8. **Transitions:** Smooth narrative flow between slides
9. **Demo preparation:** If doing live demo, create demo script
10. **Q&A prep:** Anticipate questions and prepare answers

---

## Key Questions to Resolve (When Resuming)

1. **Presentation format:** PowerPoint? Google Slides? Keynote? HTML (interactive)?
2. **Length:** How many minutes? (Affects depth of each slide)
3. **Demo component:** Live demo? Screenshots? Video recording?
4. **Handouts:** Will there be takeaway materials?
5. **Follow-up:** What's the desired outcome? Budget approval? Team buy-in? Exploration of AI tools?

## How to Resume This Work

**For the user:**
Just say "I want to continue working on the presentation" and reference this handoff doc.

**For the next Claude instance:**
1. Read this SESSION-HANDOFF.md first
2. Read the user's original `pres-outline.md`
3. Review the three completed materials (timeline, practices, slides 4-6)
4. Ask user what they want to work on next
5. Remember: User doesn't want help on Slides 7-9 yet (they'll ask when ready)
6. Be ready to gently push back on "spaghetti code" characterization when appropriate
