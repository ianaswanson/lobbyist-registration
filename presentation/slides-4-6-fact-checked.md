# Slides 4-6: Fact-Checked & Accurate

## Slide 4: The First Four Hours

### What I Did:
- **12:46 PM:** Uploaded the ordinance PDF and asked Claude: "Can you build this?"
- **12:47 PM:** Asked it to "build a prototype, I just want to see it"
- **By the end of that first session (4-5 hours):**
  - Had a **fully functional clickable prototype**
  - Captured 70% of what was in the ordinance
  - Registration wizard, expense reporting, admin dashboard, public search
  - **Deployed live to Google Cloud** - anyone could click on it

### What I Was Doing While the Agent Worked:
- Had multiple meetings
- Responded to emails
- Worked on other documents
- Checked in periodically to review progress

### First Day Results:
- Working application: ✅
- Live on the internet: ✅
- Production URL: ✅
- Demo-ready: ✅

- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform for GCP)

**Day 3 - Database Planning:**
- PostgreSQL migration planning
- Dev environment setup

**Day 4 - Feature Explosion:**
- Hour tracking for 10-hour registration threshold (§3.802)
- Appeals process with 30-day deadline tracking (§3.809)
- Contract exception management (§9.230 cooling-off period)
- Public analytics dashboard with spending trends

### **Days 5-6: Backend APIs** (Oct 19-20)

**Day 5 - UX & Admin Tools:**
- Navigation redesign with feature flags
- Board Member Calendar (§3.001 compliance - public posting)
- **Lobbyist expense report API** - full implementation
- **Admin review workflows** - approve registrations and reports

**Day 6 - Data & Testing:**
- **Employer expense report API** - full implementation
- E2E tests for admin workflows
- Data persistence fixes (save drafts, unsaved changes warnings)
- Replaced all mock data with real database queries

### **Day 7: Deployment Automation** (Oct 21)

- **Cloud Build Triggers:**
  - Dev environment: auto-deploy from `develop` branch
  - Production: manual approval from `main` branch
- Migrated to Artifact Registry (modern container storage)
- Documented 8-week modernization roadmap
- Fixed SQLite multi-instance consistency issues

### **Day 8: Modernization Sprint** (Oct 22)

**Phase 1 - Code Quality:**
- Prettier (auto-format all code)
- Husky (pre-commit hooks)
- Commitlint (standardized commit messages)

**Phase 2 - Testing:**
- Vitest unit testing infrastructure
- Component tests for UI elements

**Phase 3 - Production Infrastructure:**
- **PostgreSQL migration** (SQLite → Cloud SQL PostgreSQL)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines
- Dependabot automated security updates

**Phase 4 - Security & Monitoring:**
- Sentry error tracking (with PII filtering)
- Secret Manager migration (all secrets centralized)
- Rule of 3 demo data (realistic Portland-based seed data)

**Technical Cleanup:**
- Updated 7 API routes for Next.js 15 compatibility
- Fixed TypeScript errors (75 → 11 remaining)
- Formatted entire codebase

## Slide 6: Days 9-10 - Production Ready

### **Day 9: Production Deployment & Security** (Oct 23)

**Production PostgreSQL:**
- Fixed Cloud SQL connector configuration
- Fixed authentication environment variables
- Blue-green deployment health checks
- Multiple deployment attempts to get it right

**Security & Quality:**
- **Comprehensive security audit - production approved**
- Session timeout policy (8-hour max, 1-hour refresh)
- E2E tests running in CI pipeline
- **8 Dependabot security PRs merged** (automated dependency updates)

**Housekeeping:**
- Archived 62 historical documentation files
- Organized codebase for long-term maintenance

### **Day 10: User Administration** (Oct 24)

**7-Phase User Management System:**
- Create/edit/deactivate users (admin-only)
- Password reset with temporary passwords
- User audit log (who, what, when, from where)
- Self-protection rules (admins can't delete themselves)
- Last admin protection (system always has 1 admin)
- Search with debouncing and loading states
- Complete admin UI

**Environment Intelligence:**
- Dev environment: auto-reseeds database on startup
- Production: manual control over data reseeding
- Environment-specific session cookies
- Realistic names across all seed data

**Final Polish:**
- Prettier formatting applied to all files
- Migration baseline fixes for production
- Production deployment successful
