Presentation Notes: Playing off of TED-esque presentations and my background as a filemmaker and marketer, I want to create a presentation on "creating the lobbyist registration software". The goal is to show people the "new way" that software development can unfold with the power of AI (llms). I want to leverage emotions and myths and the power of storytelling to "incept" their minds with a very simple concept... AI can build great software, its a good thing, and we need to invest in this.

the presentation will be given to my fellow IT managers. They will span the gamut of feeling sceptical, being excited, having an emotional repel due to person relationship to AI. I am seeking to diffuse where and what I can whilst essentially setting the dynamics of the conversation. I want to use this to lay the foundation of the discussion entirely.

Here is what I am currently thinking:

Slide 1: Background
(I always assume that no one has the full picture nor the technical acumen to follow jargon, thus I always try and frame from a place of, here is everythign you need to know to arrive at the conclusion I want you to arrive at)

- Council passed an ordiance, set aside 200K (needs to be in place July 1 2026)
- Put out an RFI, we have 3 people who we had demo
- I was asked by the DCIO if it was possible to get "proposal" for if one of our development teams did the work

Slide 2: Could This Be Vibed?
- I was working with the team to figure out "what it would cost" when I stopped and wondered
"could I vibe code this?"

Slide 3: What is vibe coding
- telling an llm coding agent what you want built and letting it do the coding

Slide 4: The First Four Hours
Here is what I did the first four hours
- Uploaded the ordinance and asked it if it could built it
- Asked it to "build a prototype, i just want to see it"
- 1 hour later I had a clickable prototype that captured 70% of what was in the ordinance
- Ran a security report and made some corrections (against NIST, act as government cyber security analyst)
- I wanted to see if I could go from it working on my computer to the internet, so other people could click on it too... so I pushed it to google cloud (again, the llm coding agent did it)
- things that I was doing while the agent was working (had multiple meetings, responded to emails, worked on a document)

Slide 5: Days 2-8
- Deployed to multiple environments
- hooked up the apis (the backend where the data flows and posts *need to make this more laymans terms)
- Automated tests?
- (trying to think about what else happened, maybe need to check git commmits)

Slide 6: 9-10
- Added a bunch of other best practices (what were they, check git)
- added admin user capabilties
- another security review
- automatic deploys w/demo data

Slide 7: What is good?
- Speed, quality, better technical practices than we currently do now
- better application than we would have gotten because it fills in a lot of different perspectives, i.e. UX/UI
- ?
- could add new features with ease

Slide 8: What is not good
- I didn't look at this code, I am trusting the llm... which is fine for a proof of concept, but you need real developers doing this to leverage the AI speed and dev knowledge
- This is spaghetti and can't be managed currently because its using a ton of tech no one knows...
- ?

Slide 9: The future
- Everything in the bad column is very fixable
- This is only going to get better, this is the worst it'll be
- The cost in time and money to build is negligible
- must update your priors
