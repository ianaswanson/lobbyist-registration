**NEW:** Product manager/UX designer explaining user workflows

- "Closing talking points" section

**NEW:**
- User experience focus boxes
- Design rationale explanations (blue boxes)

- Anything about payment processing
- Anything about SSO
- Anything about what vendors have
- Defensive explanations
